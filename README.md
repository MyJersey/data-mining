# data-mining
weibo &amp; twitter data mining case based on Python
The entire project uses my coursework assignment 'Bakhmut Event' as an example for Weibo data analysis, which encompasses data collection, data cleansing, deduplication, word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, word cloud visualization, and time-based visualization features.
I will delete if there are any infringements.
